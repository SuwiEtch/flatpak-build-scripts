A collection of build scripts for building flatpak SDKs and app bundles
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~


Configure
~~~~~~~~~
To configure the behavior of a build, either edit the build.conf file
at the top level or make an alternative copy which can be supplied
to the build tooling with a --config argument.

The configuration file lets you define which branches of which
repositories should be built.


Build
~~~~~
To launch a build of the entire stack, use the build-payload.sh script.

This will checkout all the relevant sources and run the build starting
with the base runtimes, followed by the SDKs and finally the apps. If it
is not the first time you are building in the given work directory, then
the repositories will be updated and some redundant rebuilding is avoided.


Setup
~~~~~
To setup a build, use the build-setup.sh script. This script sets up your
build machine and as such will issue some commands with sudo and prompt
for your password.

The build-setup.sh script performs the following steps:

  o Installs all required host tooling using the package manager,
    currently this is only well tested on Ubuntu 16.04 installations
    but is also known to work on Debian stretch - support will need
    to be added for rpm based distros.

  o Downloads, compiles and installs flatpak and some dependencies from
    their respective git repositories (flatpak and ostree are not available
    as packages at the time of writing this).

  o Sets up a cron job to automatically run the build, running the build.

This script can be run multiple times safely. Running the build-setup.sh script
on a build machine that is already setup will result in system dependencies
being upgraded and flatpak modules to be refreshed and possibly rebuilt.
